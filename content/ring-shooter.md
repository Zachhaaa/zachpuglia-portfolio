# CAD

The plates were designed in Fusion. At first glance, the sides look the same, but they are different.

The stock was held down using a custom fixture plate. Holes are drilled into the stock where screws can be threaded into the fixture plate to hold down the stock. The hole drilling was done in the first setup.
