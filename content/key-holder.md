# Design

{{< imgtext >}}

I got inspiration for the design from what other people have made online.

 - Keys rotate out
 - The entire holder acts as a handle to turn the keys when in the lock
 - Can hold as many keys as your want if you change the size of the screws

# Why not a normal keychain?
 1. Doesn't make noise when being moved around.
 2. I can find which key I need easily since they don't change their position.
 3. Slimmer than having them on a keychain.
 4. Prevents your phone from being scratched if your have them in the same pocket.
