# 2024 Game: Crescendo

{{< imgtext >}}

This year, you score points by shooting foam donut shaped pieces called "notes" into a variety of targets.

You can check out the details in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4).

# Testing

{{< imgtext >}}

Our team went over the rules and started brainstorming ideas on how to build the best robot possible for the game.

In design, I started digitally prototyping an intake to pick up the "notes."

Prototypes were made using a laser cutter to speed up prototyping.

# Planning out The Robot

{{< imgtext >}}

We needed to figure out how all of the components fit together and how to keep all of the subsystems in sync mechanically.

We started with a drive base and slowly started configuring the rest of the robot on top of that.

We competed at 3 competitions in California and made the playoffs in all 3.

Our design won best design at our third competition.
